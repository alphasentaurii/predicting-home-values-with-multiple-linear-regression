    "* These questions should be well labled and easy to identify inside the notebook.\n",
    "* Level Up: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.\n",
    "* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project through the OSEMN framework.\n",

    "* Level Up: Whenever necessary, you briefly explain the changes made from one iteration to the next, and why you made these choices.\n",
    "* You provide at least 1 paragraph explaining your final model.\n",
    "* You pick at least 3 coefficients from your final model and explain their impact on the price of a house in this dataset."
